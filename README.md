# AssortedArduino
This is an assortment of Arduino source code I have done for a variety of projects.
It isn't well organised or documented but will get to that in due course.


##Helmet_Controller_For_RC_Car_Using_Gyro

Designed to use the LSM9DS0 Gyroscope and Accelerometer to control the motions of an RC car.
It was designed to be mounted onto a helmet and allows for a person without use of their limbs to control the RC car.
It has inbuilt handling for potentiometers to adjust the sensitivity of the pitch and roll set points (car is either on or off) so is adjustable without altering the code.
Designed for use with an Arduino Uno but can be adapted as required.

##NerfGunAutomaticTrigger

Simple script designed to automate the firing of a adapted Nerf gun that uses a spinning electric motor (like an automated pitching machine) and a solenoid.
Allows somebody to fire the Nerf gun just by pressing a button rather than having to pull and hold down the supplied trigger.

##VisibleLightGateTrip

A simple kid's game that uses 3 LDR's and LED lights to cause something to trigger when an objects rolls through them.
Designed with potentiometers in mind to alter the sensitivity of the LDR in response to the light in the room.
